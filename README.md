# LifxBMS
Company specific tool (more of a novelty) That would grab tickets from the Kaseya BMS ticketing system and flash any LIFX light
if there was a new ticket or client response.

Created using Newtonsoft, RestSharp, and the home grown BMSDK.
It was more of a challenge to see if I could do it. Development spanned a week.
